Points to pay atention:
	* If the pourpose is just to analyze data: use SD Cards to store the data;
	* If the pourpose is to visualize the data:
		-> Send data via 4G;
		-> Send data to another microcontroller with Internet access via LoRa;
	* Protection Structure: 3D printing;
	* Support Structure: Metal structure made just for it
	* Power Source:
		-> Solar panels along with 9V batteries or
		-> Power source as seen in: "Hybridized energy harvesting device based on high-performance triboelectric nanogenerator for smart agriculture applications"
